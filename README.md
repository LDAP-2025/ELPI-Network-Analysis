# ELPI Chilean Longitudinal Data Set-Network Analysis
Dani and Greta's project  
Welcome to Network Adventures!  

**Research question:**  
	â€¢ How does alcohol intake during pregnancy affect children's socio-emotional development longitudinally? - A Network Model of socio-emotional development markers for children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol  

**Preliminary Hypotheses:**  
	1. Networks become more closely connected over time (global network strength).  
	2. Global network expected influence (EI) increases with time.  
	3. Centrality measures significantly increase with time (strength, closeness, betweenness)  
	4. Modularity (Q index)  will increase with time indicating more non-random node arrangement.  
	5. Temperature changes across time.  

 **Stratification Hypotheses:**  
 	1. Changes in global network strength vary by prenatal exposure to alcohol. 
	2. Changes in global network expected influence (EI) vary by prenatal exposure.  
	3. Changes in centrality vary by prenatal exposure to alcohol.  
	4. Changes in modularity vary by prenatal exposure to alcohol.  
	5. Changes in temperature vary by prenatal exposure to alcohol.
